# AreWeGreen?

Out-of-the-box dashboard

Are all Systems up and running fine?
Are all tests passing?
These are common question developers have to answer several times a day.

AreWeGreen has the goal to empower you giving the right answers as quick as possible.

The result could look like this:

## Get started

Note: AreWeGreen is currently in alpha state.

Fetch [a release](https://github.com/hennr/arewegreen/releases) or build it from source:

    git clone https://github.com/hennr/arewegreen.git
    cd arewegreen
    mvn spring-boot:run

When run AreWeGreen will create a configuration folder (~/arewegreen) in the home directory of the current user.
Here you can define the layout and place scripts that will provide data for your board.
AreWeGreen will also start a browser automatically which opens the dashboard in a maximized window for you.
This feature can be disabled in the settings.

## Demo

A live demo can be found here: https://arewegreen.herokuapp.com/
Please give heroku a sec or two (30) to start up.
