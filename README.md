# AreWeGreen?

Out-of-the-box dashboard

Are all tests passing?
These are common question developers have to answer several times a day.

AreWeGreen has the goal to empower you giving the right answers as quick as possible.

## Get started

AreWeGreen is not yet finished. Here is the plan though:

To run AreWeGreen you simply need to fetch a release and add the executable to your autostart config.
AreWeGreen will create a configuration folder in the home directory of the current user automatically.
Here you will be able to define the layout and place scripts that will provide data for your board.
Once started AreWeGreen will start a browser which opens the dashboard in a maximized window for you.
