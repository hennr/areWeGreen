# AreWeGreen?

Out-of-the-box dashboard

Are all Systems up and running fine?
Are all tests passing?
These are common question developers have to answer several times a day.

AreWeGreen has the goal to empower you giving the right answers as quick as possible.

The result could look like this:

The UI is heavily inspired by [dashbot](https://github.com/sbstnmsch/dashbot/)


## Get started

Note: AreWeGreen is currently in alpha state.

Fetch [a release](https://github.com/hennr/arewegreen/releases) or build it from source:

    git clone https://github.com/hennr/arewegreen.git
    cd arewegreen
    mvn spring-boot:run

When run AreWeGreen will create a configuration folder (~/arewegreen) in the home directory of the current user.
Here you can define the layout and place scripts that will provide data for your board.
AreWeGreen will also start a browser automatically which opens the dashboard in a maximized window for you.
This feature can be disabled in the settings.

## Demo

A live demo can be found here: https://arewegreen.herokuapp.com/
Please give heroku a sec or two (30) to start up.

## License

AreWeGreen is licensed under the GPLv3+.

## Development

Back-End and front-end code come with hot reload support for a pleasant development experience!

Start AreWeGreen via the spring-boot maven plugin as follows:

    mvn spring-boot:run

changes to java / kotlin classes should trigger a reload of the application thanks to spring-boot-devtools.

If you want to hack on the front-end part, start parcel in watch mode as well

    cd src/main/reactjs/
    node/yarn/dist/bin/yarn watch

You have to reload http://localhost:8080 afterwards. Then all changes to JS / CSS should trigger an automatic reload in your browser.

## Thanks

I want to thank [travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/) for their free open source plans!
